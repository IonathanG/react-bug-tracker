  "data/getUserData",
  async (userID) => {
    const docRef = doc(db, "users", `${userID}`);
    const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef);

    if (docSnap.exists()) {
      console.log("Document data:", docSnap.data());
      const storedData = window.localStorage.state
        ? JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("state"))
        : undefined;

      localStorage.removeItem("state");
      return { dataDB: docSnap.data(), storedData };
    } else {
      console.log("No such document");
    }
  }
);
```

```javascript
extraReducers: {
 [getGuestData.pending]: (state) => {
      state.initUser = false;
    },
    [getGuestData.fulfilled]: (state, { payload }) => {
      if (payload) {
        state.listItems = payload.listItems;
        state.totalQuantity = payload.totalQuantity;
        state.wishList = payload.wishList;
      }
      state.initUser = true;
